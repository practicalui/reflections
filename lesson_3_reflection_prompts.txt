When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
For backup or for sharing.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
You don't want surprise changes introduced by other people.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?
fork - make a clone directly on github
clone - make a copy of a respository
branch - work on a feature or variant

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?
Can work offline and merge locally.
