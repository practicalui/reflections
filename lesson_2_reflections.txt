What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
creates a metadata file to keep metadata in. Need it so that that git has a place to store stuff when you start committing.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?
it contains the things we want to track only, and it holds the things that are not committed yet. It's a place to test before committing.
